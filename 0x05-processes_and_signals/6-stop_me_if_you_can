#We stopped our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in
#the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.
#Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.
#Requirements:
#You must not use kill/killall
#I opened 2 terminals in this example, started by running my 4-to_infinity_and_beyond Bash script in terminal #0 and then moved on terminal #1 to run 6-stop_me_if_you_can. We can then see in terminal #0 that my process has been terminated.

pkill -f 4-to_infinity_and_beyond
